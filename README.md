# Cardori
**The Discord Bot who helps you study Korean**

## Overview
Meet *Cardori* (Ïπ¥ÎèåÏù¥), a combination of "card" (Ïπ¥Îìú) and "dori" (ÎèåÏù¥), roughly translating to "Flashcard Buddy".

Cardori gives you access to the full Korean dictionary, allowing you search for any Korean word within Discord. 
In the click of a button, you can add a word along with its English translation to your flashcard set. 

To study your flashcards, just start a quiz session with Cardori. 
After every flashcard, simply provide a rating based on your recall ability.
Cardori uses these ratings and spaced-repetition technology to intelligently schedule reminders so you can stay on top of your studying.
This personalized approach ensures efficient learning and retention of Korean vocabulary over time.

## Spaced Repetition

Cardori uses a spaced repetition algorithm to calculate intervals between reminders. Inspired by [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), flashcards can exist in one of two study phases: *Learning* and *Review*. When a card is studied, both its user rating (Poor, Okay, Good) and its study phase are used to determine the factor by which to adjust its interval time. The minimum interval between reminders is 10 minutes, and the maximum interval is 1 week. Below is a breakdown of how this factor is calculated.

#### Table of Interval Factors

|      | Learning | Review |
|------|----------|--------|
| Poor | 0.5      | 0.75   |
| Okay | 1        | 1      |
| Good | 3        | 3.5    |

#### Reminders

When a card's reminder interval has passed, it will be sent out in a reminder message to the user.
Interval reminders are checked for every 30 minutes, and all scheduled card reminders are compiled into one message.
After a reminder is sent out for a card, the next reminder will not be sent out until 1 day has passed or the card has been studied.

## User Progress

Cardori tracks user progress through various metrics:
* Study Points
* Flashcards Studied
* Quizzes Completed
* Current Streak
* Longest Streak
* Badges

#### Study Points

Study points are earned through flashcard quizzes, specifically when a user rates a flashcard. 3 study points are awarded to a "Good" answer, and 1 study point is awarded to an "Okay" answer. Study points aim to encourage users to continually practice cards until a good recall level is reached. Study points cannot be used nor can they be lost. These points are merely one way to track and motivate progress.

#### Badges

Badges are awarded to users based on meeting thresholds relating to various metrics of progress.
